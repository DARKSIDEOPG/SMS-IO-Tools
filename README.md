# SMS-IO-Tools
Tools for working with models and textures in Madness Engine by Slightly Mad Studios

At this moment this repository contains a two tools:
* MEB File Patcher
* TEX File Patcher

First one need to replace the header in the *.meb files.<br>
Second one used to remove unneccessary header in the *.tex files and auto-rename it to *.dds

More information about these formats (researched by me; will be updated if more information is given) can be found here:

Both tools are written in .NET C# and requires .NET Framework 4.7.2.
